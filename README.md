## About
Hi, I'm Nick. Most people know me as Moros or M. I'm an aspiring full stack developer at the beggining of my journey. Right now I mostly have developed discord bots. I am currently enrolled in Python mastery course hoping to get my certificate. 
<br><br>
The languages I use most are Python (proficient), JavaScript (novice), and HTML (novice) with interest in learning Go and CSS.
